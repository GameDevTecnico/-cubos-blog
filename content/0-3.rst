New 0.3 Features
================

On this release, we focused on adding essential features we've been wanting to have for quite some time now.
It ended up being a tad smaller than expected, as we spent a lot of time working on non-code related stuff, such as rebranding the project.
**TODO: should we introduce the rebranding here?**

This blog post covers the most important changes, but you can check out the full changelog in our `repository <https://github.com/GameDevTecnico/cubos/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md>`_.

Next Steps
==========

**TODO: I just copied this from the previous post, we should rewrite it:**
We're very happy with the progress we've made on this release. The engine is becoming more and more powerful, and we were able to create a full game with it in a week!

For the next release, which should be out in September, we'll be **WIP**

* A **standalone editor application**. Our tools are currently integrated into the games themselves which is not ideal.
* **Audio support**, as there's no sound at all in the engine right now.
* Actual **voxel collisions**, as we currently only check the bounding boxes.
* Basic **rigidbody physics**, with rotation and friction.
* **Shadows** for all light types.
* **Web-support**, so that games can be played in the browser.
* **TODO: what else? review stuff above too**

You can check out the full list of stuff we want to get done in the `milestone <https://github.com/GameDevTecnico/cubos/milestone/27>`_ for the next release.

We're currently a team of 13 people, and **we're looking to expand**! If you're interested in joining us, or just want to learn more about the project, join our `Discord server <https://discord.gg/WjTtcNTRqD>`_!
